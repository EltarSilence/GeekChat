### Features

- GeekChat will allow users to text on a chat which can contain up to 100 users, within each user can be an administrator.
- Administrators can make other users administrator or can expel members.
- All messages will be recorded in a proper database, and the scripts will dynamically load the messages on the client. All messages can be sent in a file and then can be exported so that messages can be viewed offline as well.
- Each user can upload an image to show on his profile, and add a brief descriptive text, with a total length not exceeding 256 characters. His profile will be visualized by the other users by pressing the pseudonym (username) of the desired user.
- Once a user logs in he will be able to look for the users currently connected and the last access of users offline, all in realtime.
- In the chat you can send different types of messages:
	- Text message (including Emoji)
	- Audio message
	- Images
	- Link
	- Documents
	- Geographic positions
	- Polls
